# Example Tokio Single Thread

The goal of this project is to experiment with [tokio] & [hyper] creating an asynchronous http
server that runs **in a single tread**.

## Run in Release Mode

Run the server in `--release` mode:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Development

Run the server in dev mode with tracing in debug level:

```sh
RUST_LOG=example_tokio_single_thread=debug cargo run
```

### Watch mode

Install [cargo-watch]:

```sh
cargo install cargo-watch
```

Watch the server in dev mode with tracing in debug level:

```sh
RUST_LOG=example_tokio_single_thread=debug cargo watch -w src -x run
```

## Benchmarks

If [`wrk`](https://github.com/wg/wrk) is available you can test the performance of the server like
this:

NOTE: **First run the rust server in `--release` mode for performance tests**

```sh
# threads: 1
# open connections: 1
# run for 10s
wrk -t1 -c1 -d10s http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

There is also a plain nodejs http server available in `./node/server.js`. You can use it to compare
the performance between the two.

```bash
# start the server
node node/server.js --port 4032

# run the benchmark
wrk -t1 -c1 -d10s http://127.0.0.1:4032
```

**Next Goals**

-   integrate more benchmarking tools
-   support https & http2
-   generate [rustdoc] documentation
